# coding-notes

Hey there! :wave:

These are my personal programming notes, which play a crucial role in my ongoing journey of learning new technologies. I've always found that structuring and refactoring my own notes greatly enhances my understanding of complex concepts. 

I decided to make them public as they don't contain personal info and may inspire someone else to write their coding notes in markdown. :slightly_smiling_face:

I enjoy taking notes in Typora, a minimal Markdown editor. My favorite Typora theme is `D42ker GitHub`.

I source control my notes with git in order to access them on multiple devices and easily resolve conflicts.
