    <p>Below are things I've learned about Linux!</p>
    
    <h2>Linux Commands Cheat Sheet</h2>

    <a href="./../Linux_CLI_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Linux CLI cheat sheet</a>

    <h2>Additional Resources</h2>
    <p>For additional resources on linux visit my <a href="./pages/resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> page!</p>

    <h2>More About Image Types</h2>
    <p>For info on image types visit <a href="./pages/image_types.html" target="_blank">Image Types Page</a></p>

    <h2>A Good Commit Message</h2>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

            More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
            characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
            subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
            blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
            you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
            and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
            
            Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
            are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
            Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
            change? Here's the place to explain them.
            
            Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
            
            - Bullet points are okay, too
            
            - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
            by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
            vary here
            
            If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
            like this:
            
            Resolves: #123
            See also: #456, #789
        </code>
