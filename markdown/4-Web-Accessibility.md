# Web Accessibility

## Intro

Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of designing and developing websites that can be accessed and used by people with disabilities. It involves making websites perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

**Inclusivity**: Web accessibility aims to ensure that everyone, including people with disabilities, can access and interact with websites. It emphasizes the removal of barriers that might prevent equal access and participation.

**Disability categories**: Web accessibility encompasses a wide range of disabilities, including visual impairments, hearing impairments, mobility impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more. Understanding the challenges faced by users with different disabilities will help you design more inclusive websites.

**Standards and guidelines**: There are internationally recognized standards and guidelines that provide best practices for web accessibility. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is the most widely used and authoritative set of guidelines.



**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**: WCAG is a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provides a framework for creating accessible web content. It is organized into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (commonly referred to as the "POUR" principles). Each principle has specific guidelines and success criteria to help ensure accessibility.

1. **Perceivable**: Perceivability refers to ensuring that information on a website is available to all users. This involves providing text alternatives for non-text content, offering captions for multimedia, and designing for color-blind users.
2. **Operable**: Operability focuses on making websites functional and navigable for all users. It involves providing keyboard accessibility, giving users enough time to interact with content, and avoiding content that could cause seizures or physical reactions.
3. **Understandable**: Understandability ensures that website content and functionality are clear and easy to comprehend for all users. It includes using plain language, organizing content logically, and providing clear instructions.
4. **Robust**: Robustness refers to creating websites that can be interpreted and accessed by a wide variety of user agents (e.g., browsers, assistive technologies). It involves using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices to ensure compatibility and future-proofing.



In addition to WCAG, it's worth exploring other resources and standards like the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification, which provides additional techniques for enhancing web accessibility, particularly for dynamic and interactive content.
