WHEN `foo` is a **bash command**..

`help` list common commands and their syntax

`whatis foo`

`foo --help`

`man foo` --> use `/` to search

`tldr foo` a simplified version of `man` with practical examples

`apropos foo`

`man 8 foo`



**Search for directories or files (search paths)**

`locate <string>` after `updatedb` will search *all* paths for *string*

`?` represents any single character

`*` represents zero or more characters

`locate <string> | grep <string>`

`find` returns every path in the pwd

`find | grep <string>`

`fzf` is like `find` - displays all paths in the pwd - but also allows interactive searching - THIS

`fzf -q <string>` - start `fzf` by already searching for *string*

see SEARCHING in Linux notes for more info



**Search within files**

`grep`

*grep does not search file/directory names (only file *contents*)

*grep **does not** search **recursively** by default

`grep <string> foo.txt` search for *string* in foo.txt

`grep <string> *` search for *string* in all files in pwd

`grep -r <string> *` search recursively for *string* in pwd



`ack` 

*ack does not search file/directory names (only file *contents*)

*ack **does** search **recursively** by default

*ack will exclude files it finds to be logically irrelevant to the developer (for example ack excludes .gitlog files)

`find . | wc -l` list total number of files/directories in `.`

`ack -f | wc -l` list number of files `ack` will search the contents of

`ack -f` list the files `ack` will search the contents of

`ack -f --html` list all `html` files ack finds relevent

`ack <string>` search for *string* in all files in the pwd

`ack -w <string>` search for *string* where *string* is a complete word (not surrounded by any other letters)

`ack --html <string>` search for *string* but only in `html` files (also `css` `js` `python` `md` `txt` etc)

*pipe output into `less` if it is a lot



`Ctrl Z` send nano to background

`fg` bring back to foreground



`cd -` previous directory

`ls` display contents of current working directory (sorted alphabetically)

`ls -a` show all (hidden) files/directories

`ls -d` show only directories

`ls -l` show permissions, number of hard links, owner, group owner, file size in **bytes**, last modified, and file/directroy name

*number of hard links can be confusing - it's not necessarly ones you have created with `ln` - don't worry about it

`ls -l -t` sort by most recent first - use `-r` to reverse the sort order

`ls -l -h` show human readable file sizes - use `-S` to sort by size (largest first)

Bit - smallest fundamental size of data storage - a binary digit - 1/8 of a byte

B byte = 8 bits - stores a string of eight 1's or 0's - the byte is the smallest unit for the base 1,024 naming system - **if no unit is displayed** in Linux -> the unit is **bytes**



K kibibyte = 1,024 bytes (2^10 bytes) = roughly 1 Kilobyte

M mebibyte = 1,048,576 bytes (2^20 bytes) = roughly 1 Megabyte

G gibibyte = 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30 bytes) = roughly 1 Gigabyte

T tebibyte = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes (2^40 bytes) = roughly 1 Terabyte



KB kilobyte = 1,000 bytes (10^3 bytes) one thousand bytes

MB megabyte = 1,000,000 (10^6 bytes) one million bytes

GB gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 (10^9 bytes) one billion bytes

TB terabyte = 1,000,000,000,000 (10^12 bytes) one trillion bytes



`xdg-open` open file(s) with default program



`ps` display currently active processes

`top` display all running processes

`htop` a newer version of `top` - is better

## Bash Tricks

#### Wget

easily download files using a variety of different protocols

will download to the pwd..

`wget https://download.com/file.zip`

you can also create a text file..

`gedit wget-downloads.txt` containing a list of files to download

`wget -i ./wget-downloads.txt` the i option stands for 'input file'



#### Download a file/folder from GitHub

use `svn` (subversion) which has many other options other than `export`

use `svn help` to learn more



first let's see what's in the remote with..

`svn ls URL.git`

for example..

`svn ls https://github.com/parktart/odin-recipes.git`



from there we can choose a branch for example..

`svn ls https://github.com/parktart/odin-recipes.git/trunk`



and continue to find the file/folder we want..

then we use..

`svn export <path>` to download the file/folder



if the file/folder is not on trunk (main)..

`svn export URL.git/branches/<branch_name>/<folder>`



for a specific tagged commit..

`svn export URL.git/tags/<tag_name>/<folder>`



**note** if there are special characters (like spaces) in the path then you must replace them with the correct URL encoding

for example replace a space with `%20`



#### Copy standard output

`cat foo.txt | xclip - selection clipboard` copy the contents of `foo.txt` to your clipboard



#### Compare files

`icdiff left_file right_file`

options..

`-N, --line-numbers` show line numbers

`-r, --recursive` recursively compare subdirectories

`-s` report when two files are the same



`code --diff left_file right_file` will compare them in VSCode



#### Fig autocomplete utility

https://fig.io/user-manual/linux#supported-distros

is in beta > did not install through `apt` > see above link to **uninstall**

if having **issues** with `fig` --> run `fig doctor` to debug it --> after that see above link

UNINSTALLED (didn't work well yet)



#### Merge PDF Files

`pdfunite` is part of the the `poppler-utils` package..

`sudo apt install poppler-utils`

`pdfunite file1.pdf file2.pdf merged_output.pdf`

ignore the errors

note: files to be merged need to be in the same directory that `pdfunite` is executed





ok
