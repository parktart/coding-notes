# Windows cmd and PowerShell

## Windows Cmd

Windows cmd is case **insensitive**

So command `cd` is the same as `CD`

It also means that file `HelloWorld.cs` is the same as `helloworld.cs`

However you may be working with files that will be used in a system that is case **sensitive**, so be very careful!

`Home/End` = move curser beginning/end of line

`Esc` = clear all on current line

`exit` = close the terminal window



`cmd` = `bash`

`cls` = `clear`

`start` = `xdg-open`

`type` = `cat`

`more` = `less`

`dir` = `ls`

`dir /a` = including hidden

`dir /ah` = only hidden

`cd` = `cd`

`mkdir` = `mkdir`

`rmdir` = `rmdir`

`del` = `rm`

`del /s` = `rm -rf`

`move` = `mv` (can be used to rename files)

`ren` = rename

`copy` = `cp`

`echo` = display text or enable/disable echoing of commands

`echo. > myfile.txt` create an empty file



## PowerShell







## Visual Studio cmd

`devenv` (Visual Studio IDE Command-Line Tool):

- You would typically use `devenv` when you want to perform operations related to Visual Studio itself, such as managing projects, solutions, and the Visual Studio IDE.
- Examples of `devenv` usage:
  - Opening a Visual Studio solution: `devenv MySolution.sln`
  - Building a specific project within a solution: `devenv MySolution.sln /Build "MyProject"`
  - Running Visual Studio from the command line: `devenv`
- `devenv` is specific to Visual Studio and is primarily used for managing the development environment and working with Visual Studio projects.



`dotnet` (Dotnet CLI):

- You would typically use `dotnet` when you want to perform operations related to building, running, and managing .NET applications and libraries.
- Examples of `dotnet` usage:
  - Creating a new console application: `dotnet new console`
  - Building a .NET project: `dotnet build`
  - Running a .NET application: `dotnet run`
  - Managing NuGet packages: `dotnet add package`
- `dotnet` is a cross-platform tool that can be used to interact with .NET projects and solutions, regardless of whether they were created in Visual Studio or another development environment.



In summary, if you are working with Visual Studio itself, managing solutions, projects, and the Visual Studio IDE, you would use `devenv`. On the other hand, if you want to build, run, and manage .NET applications and libraries, regardless of the development environment, you would use `dotnet`.
