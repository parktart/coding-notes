# Windows cmd and powershell

Windows cmd is case **insensitive**

So command `cd` is the same as `CD`

It also means that file `HelloWorld.cs` is the same as `helloworld.cs`

However you may be working with files that will be used in a system that is case **sensitive**, so be very careful!

`Home/End` = move curser beginning/end of line

`Ctrl Left/Right` = move curser per word

`Ctrl A` select all on current line

`exit` = close the terminal window



`cmd` = `bash`

`start` = `xdg-open`

`type` = `cat`

`more` = `less`

`dir` = `ls`

`dir /a` = including hidden

`dir /ah` = only hidden

`cd` = `cd`

`mkdir` = `mkdir`

`rmdir` = `rmdir`

`del` = `rm`

`del /s` = `rm -rf`

`move` = `mv` (can be used to rename files)

`ren` = rename

`copy` = `cp`

`echo` = display text or enable/disable echoing of commands

`echo. > myfile.txt` create an empty file
